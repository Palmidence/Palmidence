## Welcome to my site!

I am a music producer, aspiring web developer, and former Minecraft map maker with 5 years under my belt.

### Experience

I have gone through a lot in my journey. I have done the following:
- **Team building** using engaging leadership strategies, adapting to different styles of learning
- **Proficience** in XML, HTML, YML, JSON, and virtually any markup language using hands-on learning
- **Marketed and administrated** for many networks and businesses, establishing branches of contact for partners

### Minecraft Work

Though it is mostly of the past, I have done quite a bit while I was actively working with Minecraft. This includes:
- Administrating for the [Avicus Network, LLC](https://www.linkedin.com/company/10072740/) (Oversaw 50+ staff, managed 8 sectors of the team, ran tournaments)
- Map Developing for the Avicus Network, LLC (Managed team, used XML/YML to configure matches, oversaw rotations)
- Map Developing for the Stratus Network (Expansive XML work, coordinated team of 10 dedicated members)
- Volunteer moderating for numerous servers, taking leadership initatives
- Creating music for Minecraft mods such as [EssentialFeatures](https://github.com/williambl/EssentialFeatures)

### Music Work

I specialize in electronic music production. I shape the way I want to listen to music with 80's music fusioned into modern styled songs. I am fluent in working with genres such as [Synthwave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthwave_(2000s_genre)), [Vaporwave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaporwave), [Drum 'n' Bass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drum_and_bass), and [Ambience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambient_music). I am still new in learning how to produce music, and I've only been producing for a little over a year, so I still have much to learn!
